  Hi! I'm Paige. I'm currently working on a Masters degree in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington, where I'm a member of the <a href="https://clmbr.shane.st/">CLMBR research group</a>.

  <br /><br />
  Before returning to grad school, I spent 3 years working as a software developer at <a href="https://www.defmethod.com/">Def Method</a> in NYC and <a href="https://smartlogic.io/">SmartLogic</a> in Baltimore. Before that, I studied literature as an undergrad, spent a year as a Fulbright research fellow (studying Japanese feminist literary criticism) at <a href="http://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp/">Nagoya University</a> in Japan, and did one year of a PhD program in English Literature before dropping out to pursue a career in software development.

  <br /><br />
  I'm excited about languages, both natural and otherwise, and about the potential for NLP to do good in the world. These days, I live in Baltimore county with my husband and our dog.
