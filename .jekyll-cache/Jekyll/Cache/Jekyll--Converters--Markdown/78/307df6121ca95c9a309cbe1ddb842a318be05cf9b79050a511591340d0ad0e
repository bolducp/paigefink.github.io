  Hi! I'm Paige. I'm currently working on a Masters degree in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington, where I'm a member of the <a href="https://clmbr.shane.st/">CLMBR research group</a>.

  <br /><br />
  Before returning to grad school, I spent 3 years working as a software developer at <a href="https://www.defmethod.com/">Def Method</a> in NYC and <a href="https://smartlogic.io/">SmartLogic</a> in Baltimore.
